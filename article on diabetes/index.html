                        <figcaption>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not 
                            produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
                             Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised 
                             blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and 
                             over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves 
                             and blood vessels.</figcaption>

                    <h3>Types of diabetes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diabetes Type 1:
                            <p>Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or
                                 childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires 
                                 daily administration of insulin.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Diabetes Type 2:
                            <p>Type 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. 
                                It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar 
                                if not treated.Over time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, 
                                especially nerves and blood vessels.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>PreDiabetes:</h3>
                    <p>Prediabetes is the term that's used when your blood sugar is higher than expected, 
                        but it's not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when the cells in your body 
                        don't respond to insulin the way they should. 
                        This can lead to type 2 diabetes down the road.</p>

                    <h3>Diabetes Type 1:</h3>
                    <p>Doctors don't know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, 
                        the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
                        Genes may play a role in some people. It's also possible that a virus 
                        sets off an immune system attack.</p>

                        <h3>Diabetes Type 2:</h3>
                        <p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. 
                            Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, 
                            especially in your belly,  makes your cells more resistant to the 
                            effects of insulin on your blood sugar.
                            This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more 
                            likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>

                        <figcaption>Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. 
                            Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose. 
                        People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle.
                        Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood 
                        sugar levels. These can include insulin injections or other medicines. 
                        Some examples include:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metformin</li>
                        <li>Sulfonylureas</li>
                        <li>Sodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to 
                        lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications.</p>
                    <p>Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Foot care to treat ulcers</li>
                        <li>Screening and treatment for kidney disease</li>
                        <li>Eye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness)</li>
